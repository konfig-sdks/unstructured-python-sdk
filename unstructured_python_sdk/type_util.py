    Unstructured Pipeline API

    At Unstructured, we're on a mission to give organizations access to all of their data. We know the world runs on documentsâ€”from research reports and memos, to quarterly filings and plans of action, documents are the unit of information that companies depend on. And yet, 80% of this information is trapped in inaccessible formats, and businesses have long struggled to unlock this data, leading to information silos, inefficient decision-making, and repetitive work. Until now.  Unstructured captures this unstructured data wherever it lives and transforms it into AI-friendly JSON files for companies who are eager to fold AI into their business.
